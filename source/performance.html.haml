      i did a performance where i sat at a desk and pretended to work on a computer,
      with no screen. i typed on a keyboard, which controlled a music synthesis program
      on a hidden computer. the ascii key codes were mapped to sequential midi notes.

      this was a collaboration where each one of us performed a repetitive action
      as part of a cycle, which gradually accelerated in speed. evan and i worked
      to create an audiovisual representation of this cycle which was projected onto
      the performance space. i composed a small piece of music for each person's action,
      each of which was illuminated by overhead lights during the cyclical increments.
