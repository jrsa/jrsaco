for image upload:

put images into folders
    generic image dump/tumblr folder
    project folder
        can get project images by {prefix: "/projects/#{project.slug}/"}


make two JPEG versions of every image:

    mogrify -path thumb/ -gravity west -shave 30x30% -quality 70 -format jpg *
    mogrify -path full/ -gravity west -shave 10x10% -quality 90 -format jpg *

    scripts:
        size according to above (probably use the above magckal invocations in a shell script)
        upload of both sets of images to s3 bucket with proper permissions/caching headers
        verify that thumbnail exists for every full size image and is correct as above
        make sure every project has a pair of images

boss mode:
    launchd watches the above folders, sizes images, and uploads with script
