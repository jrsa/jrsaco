The image processing component of 3D SANDBOX was written using openFrameworks. The oF application stores and processes frames from a USB camera to create the "stereoscopic delay" effect. The output is a mix of the newest frame of video and a frame delayed in time. Each is colorized to red or cyan. When the motion control unit signals completion of a full arc, the colorization of the two frames is switched to match the new direction of motion.

Incoming video frames are stored using ofTexture objects arranged in a circular buffer. The most recently updated frame and the frame at some subtracted offset in the buffer are given as inputs to a GLSL pixel shader, where they are converted to luma-valued images and assigned to either the red, or both the green and blue output channels.
